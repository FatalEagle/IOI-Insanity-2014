<h2>Problem C: Pie Shop</h2>

<p>Dorian loves pies, and he especially loves his local pie shop &mdash; that's why he's bought an all-you-can-eat pie dinner! The pies have been arranged into a grid with <var>R</var> rows and <var>C</var> columns (1 &le; <var>R</var>, <var>C</var> &le; 16). The pie in row <var>i</var> and column <var>j</var> has a tastiness value <var>t<sub>i j</sub></var> (0 &le; <var>t<sub>i j</sub></var> &le; 1000). Dorian is a messy eater, and whenever he eats a pie, he destroys all pies adjacent to it. He would like to maximize the sum of the tastiness values of the pies he eats, and also figure out how many ways he can achieve this sum.</p>

<p>Two pies are adjacent if they are exactly 1 unit of distance apart; that is, |<var>x</var><sub>1</sub> &minus; <var>x</var><sub>2</sub>| + |<var>y</var><sub>1</sub> &minus; <var>y</var><sub>2</sub>| = 1.</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
The first line contains two space-separated integers <var>R</var> and <var>C</var>.<br/>
The next <var>R</var> lines each contain <var>C</var> space-separated integers representing the tastiness values of the pies.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>A single line containing two space-separated integers: the maximum possible sum and the number of ways to reach this sum. Since the number of ways may be very large, you should give the value modulo 1000000007 (10<sup>9</sup> + 7).</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>If your program is correctly formatted and gets the first number correct but not the second, you will receive 40% of the points for the test case. If both numbers are correct, you will receive 100% of the points for the test case.</p>

<h3>Subtask 1 [30% of points]</h3>

<p><var>R</var> = 1.</p>

<h3>Subtask 2 [30% of points]</h3>

<p><var>R</var> &le; 10.</p>

<h3>Subtask 3 [40% of points]</h3>

<p>There are no additional restrictions.</p>
