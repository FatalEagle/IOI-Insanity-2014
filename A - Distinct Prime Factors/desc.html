<h2>Problem A: Distinct Prime Factors</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
"What do we make them do for problem A?"<br/>
"Uh&hellip; make them prime factorize a number."<br/>
"Isn't that a bit too easy?"<br/>
"Fine, make them prime factorize a BIG number."<br/>
"Like with GNFS? Isn't that a bit too hard?"<br/>
"Fine, let's make them prime factorize <em>a lot</em> of numbers."<br/>
"Just how many are you thinking?"<br/>
"<b>All of them.</b>"<br/>
"wat."<br/>
"k screw this, let's slap on some bounds and call it a day."

<p>Given two integers <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> (2 &le; <var>A</var> &le; <var>B</var> &le; 1000000), determine the number of distinct prime factors for each integer between A and B, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line will contain the integer <var>A</var>, and the second line will contain the integer <var>B</var>.</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>The output should contain <var>B</var> &minus; <var>A</var> + 1 lines. Each line should contain a single integer, the number of distinct prime factors of <var>A</var>, <var>A</var>+1, &hellip;, <var>B</var>.</p>
