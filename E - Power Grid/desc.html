Power Grid
You are the new manager of a power plant. You realize that the company is losing money because it is forced to keep power levels high even when most of the houses are not using the power. Therefore, you decide to make a reform. You will select a subset of houses to maximize your profit. There is a catch: if you select a house, you must also provide power to some other houses connected to it which are linked by wires that travel in one direction. Each house has a maximum voltage use. You must provide at least enough power to satisfy this value of all houses you choose to provide to. Each house also has an integer which is the expected profit. Write a program to determine the maximum profit you can gain, if the cost to produce V voltage is A * V.
N houses, M wires
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= M <= 400
0 <= A <= 10000
-10000000 <= p_i <= 10000000
1 <= v_i <= 100000

Input Format
N M A
[p_i v_i] * N
[a_i b_i] * M

Sample Output 1
8

Explanation
Select only the fourth and fifth houses for a revenue of 12, then produce 4 volts to satisfy them, for a profit of 12 - 4 = 8.

Sample Input 2

1 3

Sample Output 2
0

Explanation
It is not profitable to do provide power to any house because the cost of production is too much compared to the gains you could get by selecting any valid subset of houses.
